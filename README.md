<p>Explanations:<br>

In addition to making a new table (Address) and creating its Context and Controller (with its basic CRUD requests), I have implemented 3 API methods.<br>

The first is a 3rd GET method, which takes in a student id as input and returns the addresses listed under the student.<br>

The second is the 2nd PUT method, which takes the student as input and proceeds to update the the student's address.<br>

Lastly, the third API method is the 2nd POST method. It takes the student id as input and proceeds to insert a new tuple in the Address table with the student id.</p>
